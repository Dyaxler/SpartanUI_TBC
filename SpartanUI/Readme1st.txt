# SpartanUI

Welcome to SpartanUI for The Burning Crusade WoW 2.4.3 - originally written by Ansu.

This is a custom version based on my backport of SpartainUI_Vanilla available here: https://github.com/Dyaxler/SpartanUI_Vanilla. The biggest change is that I've updated it to use Bartender 4 as opposed to Bartender 3. Tons of code fixes and tweaks were updated in this version of the classic SpartanUI. Please report any issues you have with this version here on GitHub.

**There is a fairly large MobInfo database included with this release. I recommend that you use it because it will populate your target frame with Mobs real (or close to real/average) HP/Mana data. Just move MobInfo2.lua from 'Backup MobInfo' to your global 'SavedVariables' folder and it will be available for all your toons.
