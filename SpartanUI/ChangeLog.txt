v2.14:
* Initial release

* The original release for SpartanUI for TBC v 2.4.3 included Bartender3. I've upgraded it to use
  Bartender4.

* I have incorporated my version of Adapt along with the code base I used for the Vanilla client.
  It contains several fixes.

* ClearFont was added to the pack because the default fonts are just ugly.

* I've included my MobInfo2 database with this release. Although it might not be needed since TBC
  now allows you to querry the for mob health.
